	abstract = {The activity of neurons of the medial posterior parietal area V6A in macaque monkeys is modulated by many aspects of reach task. In the past, research was mostly focused on modulating the effect of single parameters upon the activity of V6A cells. Here, we used Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) to simultaneously test the contribution of several factors upon V6A cells during a ﬁx-to-reach task. This approach resulted in the deﬁnition of a representative ‘‘functional ﬁngerprint’’ for each neuron. We ﬁrst studied how the features are distributed in the population. Our analysis highlighted the virtual absence of units strictly selective for only one factor and revealed that most cells are characterized by ‘‘mixed selectivity.’’ Then, exploiting our GLM framework, we investigated the dynamics of spatial parameters encoded within V6A. We found that the tuning is not static, but changed along the trial, indicating the sequential occurrence of visuospatial transformations helpful to guide arm movement.},

This ﬂexible technique can be adapted to test and quantify the contributions of many different parameters (e.g., kinematics, target position, choice, reward) on neural activity. To weight the inﬂuence of each parameter, we developed an intuitive metric (‘‘w-value’’) that can be used to build a ‘‘functional ﬁngerprint’’ characteristic for each neuron.

	abstract = {The classical view on motor control makes a clear distinction between the role of motor cortex in controlling muscles and parietal cortex in processing movement plans and goals. However, the strong parieto-frontal con­ nections argue against such clear-cut separation of function. Modern dynamical approaches revealed that pop­ ulation activity in motor cortex can be captured by a limited number of patterns, called neural states that are preserved across diverse motor behaviors. Whether such dynamics are also present in parietal cortex is unclear. Here, we studied neural dynamics in the primate parietal cortex during arm movements and found three main states temporally coupled to the planning, execution and target holding epochs. Strikingly, as reported recently in motor cortex, execution was subdivided into distinct, arm acceleration- and deceleration-related, states. These results suggest that dynamics across parieto-frontal areas are highly consistent and hint that parietal population activity largely reflects timing constraints while motor actions unfold.},

	abstract = {In the past, neuroscience was focused on individual neurons seen as the functional units of the nervous system, but this approach fell short over time to account for new experimental evidence, especially for what concerns associative and motor cortices. For this reason and thanks to great technological advances, a part of modern research has shifted the focus from the responses of single neurons to the activity of neural ensembles, now considered the real functional units of the system. However, on a microscale, individual neurons remain the computational components of these networks, thus the study of population dynamics cannot prescind from studying also individual neurons which represent their natural substrate. In this new framework, ideas such as the capability of single cells to encode a specific stimulus (neural selectivity) may become obsolete and need to be profoundly revised. One step in this direction was made by introducing the concept of “mixed selectivity,” the capacity of single cells to integrate multiple variables in a flexible way, allowing individual neurons to participate in different networks. In this review, we outline the most important features of mixed selectivity and we also present recent works demonstrating its presence in the associative areas of the posterior parietal cortex. Finally, in discussing these findings, we present some open questions that could be addressed by future studies.},

	abstract = {In the macaque monkey, area V6A, located in the medial posterior parietal cortex, contains cells that encode the spatial position of a reaching target. It has been suggested that during reach planning this information is sent to the frontal cortex along a parieto-frontal pathway that connects V6A–premotor cortex–M1. A similar parieto-frontal network may also exist in the human brain, and we aimed here to study the timing of this functional connection during planning of a reaching movement toward different spatial positions. We probed the functional connectivity between human area V6A (hV6A) and the primary motor cortex (M1) using dual-site, paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation with a short (4 ms) and a longer (10 ms) interstimulus interval while healthy participants (18 men and 18 women) planned a visually-guided or a memory-guided reaching movement toward positions located at different depths and directions. We found that, when the stimulation over hV6A is sent 4 ms before the stimulation over M1, hV6A inhibits motor-evoked potentials during planning of either rightward or leftward reaching movements. No modulations were found when the stimulation over hV6A was sent 10 ms before the stimulation over M1, suggesting that only short medial parieto-frontal routes are active during reach planning. Moreover, the short route of hV6A–premotor cortex–M1 is active during reach planning irrespectively of the nature (visual or memory) of the reaching target. These results agree with previous neuroimaging studies and provide the first demonstration of the flow of inhibitory signals between hV6A and M1.},

	abstract = {The projections from the claustrum to cortical areas within and adjacent to the superior parietal lobule were studied in 10 macaque monkeys, using retrograde tracers, computerized reconstructions, and quantitative methods. In contrast with the classical view that posterior parietal areas receive afferents primarily from the dorsal and posterior regions of the claustrum, we found that these areas receive more extensive projections, including substantial afferents from the anterior and ventral regions of the claustrum. Moreover, our findings uncover a previously unsuspected variability in the precise regions of the claustrum that originate the projections, according to the target areas. For example, areas dominated by somatosensory inputs for control of body movements tend to receive most afferents from the dorsal-posterior claustrum, whereas those which also receive significant visual inputs tend to receive more afferents from the ventral claustrum. In addition, different areas within these broadly defined groups differ in terms of quantitative emphasis in the origin of projections. Overall, these results argue against a simple model whereby adjacency in the cortex determines adjacency in the sectors of claustral origin of projections and indicate that subnetworks defined by commonality of function may be an important factor in defining claustrocortical topography.},
