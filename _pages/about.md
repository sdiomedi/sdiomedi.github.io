I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences at the University of Bologna, in the Neurophysiology of the visuomotor sistem laboratory headed by Prof. Patrizia Fattori.

ðŸ§  About Me:

I am Applied Mathematician and Neuroscientist researching the role of the parietal cortex in motor control using an interdiscipl.

ðŸ”¬ Experimental approach:

I use experimental techniques such as electrophysiological recordings of single neurons, kinematic tracking, eye movement analysis and immersive virtual reality.

ðŸ’» Data Analysis and Modeling:

The neural data analysis techniques I favour are machine learning,neural networks , Hidden Markov Models and dimensionality reduction techniques.
