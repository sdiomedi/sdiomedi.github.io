I am a Senior Research Fellow at the Institute of Cognitive Sciences and Technologies of Padova, Italy, working on neurocomputational modelling and supervised by Ivilin Stoianov. I also collaborate intensively with the laboratory Neurophysiology of the visuomotor sistem lead by Prof. Patrizia Fattori at University of Bologna.

🧠 About Me:

I am Applied Mathematician and Neuroscientist researching the role of the parietal cortex in motor control using an interdiscipl.

🔬 Experimental approach:

I use experimental techniques such as electrophysiological recordings of single neurons, kinematic tracking, eye movement analysis and immersive virtual reality.

💻 Data Analysis and Modeling:

The neural data analysis techniques I favour are machine learning,neural networks , Hidden Markov Models and dimensionality reduction techniques.
